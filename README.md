RoboIME's firmware project
==========================

This is the project of the firmware that goes into the robot.

The board used is an [STM32 F4 Discovery](http://www.st.com/web/catalog/tools/FM116/SC959/SS1532/PF252419) board.

To compile this project the [CooCox CoIDE](http://www.coocox.org/CooCox_CoIDE.htm) is required.

There is an ongoing effort to write a Makefile to cross compile the project with arm-none-eabi-gcc.
